# Protein Calculator iOS App

iOS app built with SwiftUI to evaluate protein makeup percentage of food items based on a user's body weight and caloric goals
ideal for users that want to be in a high protein, low caloric diet

---

## Features

- input daily caloric goal and body weight (lbs or kg)
  - toggle between metric and imperial units
- save settings locally with `@AppStorage`
- evaluate food items by calories and grams of protein
- calculate whether a food item meets your recommended protein range
  - visual cues: meets target, too low, too high
- SwiftUI interface with `ScrollView` and `NavigationView`
